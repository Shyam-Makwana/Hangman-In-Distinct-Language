## Introduction

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

## How to play hangman

- Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.

- You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.

- Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).

- If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appear will be revealed.

- After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.

- Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you loose a life and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.

- Most frequently, the person is drawn in 6 parts (for 6 letter guesses) in the order: head, body, left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm.

- Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.
